This structure includes the following elements:

    Import statements: Used to import required modules or packages.

    Global variables: Variables defined outside of any function and are accessible throughout the program.

    Function definitions: A section where individual functions are defined. Each function should have a docstring explaining its purpose and arguments.

    Main function: This is the main function where all other functions are tied together and the flow of the program is controlled.

    Call to main function: The last section of the code calls the main function using an if __name__ == "__main__": statement, which is a standard way to check if the code is being executed as a standalone program or being imported as a module into another program.

This structure makes it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code.
