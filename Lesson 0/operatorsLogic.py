# This program demonstrates the basic logical operations in Python

# Define two variables, x and y
x = 5
y = 10

# Use the greater than operator, ">"
print("x is greater than y:", x > y)

# Use the less than operator, "<"
print("x is less than y:", x < y)

# Use the equal to operator, "=="
print("x is equal to y:", x == y)

# Use the not equal to operator, "!="
print("x is not equal to y:", x != y)

# Use the greater than or equal to operator, ">="
print("x is greater than or equal to y:", x >= y)

# Use the less than or equal to operator, "<="
print("x is less than or equal to y:", x <= y)
